Painter is a chrome extension which adds the ability to use a drawing pad right in your browser without leaving your current page.

How to use:

- Download everything
- Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser
- Extract if necessary and drag and drop the root folder in to the extension’s page. Alternatively you can <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging">package the project </a> into a .crx extension package.
- A Dialog should appear, select ‘Add’ and the extension will be installed and should appear next to your omnibox.
- the extensions icon is a smiley face.
- Click the Icon and you can start drawing.
- To save, press the save button, this will take you to another window where you can right click the image and ‘save as’ (I want to improve this, the saving should be more seamless.)
